# Survival Analysis and Customer Lifetime Value Estimation

## Project Overview
This project applies survival analysis techniques to a telecommunications dataset to understand customer churn and calculate the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) based on different service subscriptions. The goal is to identify key factors affecting customer retention and quantify the value each customer segment brings over time.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arturavagyan2/MA_HW_3.git
```

### Usage

To run the simulation and visualize the results, use the the AFT_CLV.ipynb notebook.
